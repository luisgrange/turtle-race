A python turtle race game


### Why?

This is a good question, I create that because I was bored... i thought about forget programming <br>
and that stuff... and I decided play my pong game made in python wilhe i was watching teenager mutant ninja turtle
the i thought "Why not? I have free time".
Build games with turtle is pretty simple, but is cool when you see that you can make those things

### Usage
It's pretty simple, open you IDE or text editor, run the script and here we are <br>
I put just 3 turtles because I was tired and I didn't have coffee in my cup 😢

### How is it Works?
As I said before, I used Python's Turtle library to build because I need learn about PyGame<br>
I made as simple as possible, but I want improve that, put sounds, more turtles... asks which color user wants, etc.

For now, we have just shapes, 3 turtles and 1 rectangle to mark where is the arravil line.
When a turtle cross this line, the game stops and is printed who is the winner.
Of course i couldn't let someone wins always, right? So, the speed is random, don't need kick me now 😎
I hope someone can enjoy this game, and please Don't use this game to place bets!!!!
